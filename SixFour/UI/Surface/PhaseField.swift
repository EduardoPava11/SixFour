/// per-phase renderer, all drawing onto the ONE surface.
///
/// Under the A/B genome shift the lifecycle collapses to **capture → A/B → export**, so
/// only five renderers are routed: `BootstrapPhaseField` / `UnauthorizedPhaseField` /
/// `LivePhaseField` / the new `ABCandidatePhaseField` (the `.captured` + `.picked` A/B
/// game) / `ErrorPhaseField`, plus minimal exporting/done fields. The cut renderers
/// (Settings / Capturing / Browsing / Rendering / Review) are no longer routed but left in
/// place. A phase change re-draws cells on the ONE surface — no view swap.
