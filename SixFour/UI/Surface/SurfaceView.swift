/// THE single mounted view. `SixFourApp`'s `WindowGroup` hosts exactly this. It owns σ
/// (`Surface`), κ (`SurfaceClock`), AND the capture engine (`CaptureViewModel` — the
/// AVCaptureSession + burst + deterministic Zig render driver). Its body is the phase-
/// field projection Π of σ: `PhaseField.field(for: σ.phase, σ, κ)`. A phase change
/// re-draws cells on this same surface — there is no view swap, no modal cover, no
/// `NavigationStack`. capture → render → review are phases of the one field.
///
/// The engine is the ENGINE, not the router: σ.phase is the single source of truth for
/// what the surface shows. `SurfaceView` watches the engine's progress and maps it onto
/// σ through `step(_:)` events (`SessionReady`/`AuthDenied`/`LockComplete`/`BurstComplete`
/// /`StageDone`/`Committed`/`Fault`). The shutter tap (a σ event) kicks the engine's
/// `capture()`; the engine's outputs flow back into σ (palette + index cube).
///
/// Lifecycle: the clock runs while the window is active and stops when it backgrounds
/// (zero idle battery). Reduce-motion is forwarded to the clock. On first appearance the
/// Swift↔Haskell phase-FSM parity is asserted (debug only) and the engine bootstraps.
